# Quick guide for the process we use on GitHub

## Contributing to Files UWP

To get started, create a fork of the repository on GitHub. You will need to do that to make any changes since the Files UWP repo is restricted to a few contributors of the app. If you decide to make a change you should always do it on the `master` branch. Once your change is completed you can open a pull request which we will review and merge if it aligns with our vision for Files UWP.

All pull requests should have an equivalent issue that has been approved and placed in the project board. This will help ensure that changes align with our vision of Files UWP as well as avoid duplicate work.
